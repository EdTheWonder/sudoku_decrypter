# Pure Truth Verification

## Core Principle
Truth requires no assumptions, not even the assumption of measurement.

## Initial State
1. No assumptions
2. No measurements
3. No comparisons

## Proven Properties
1. Truth is pure verification
2. Verification needs no measurement
3. All assumptions must be removed

## Implementation
The code provides verification through:
1. Pure truth structure
2. Verification without measurement
3. No assumptions of any kind

## Significance
This system demonstrates that fundamental truth requires no assumptions. All claims about measurements, comparisons, properties, constants, and even the need for verification itself were assumptions that had to be removed.

The law is simpler than we thought: truth just is.
